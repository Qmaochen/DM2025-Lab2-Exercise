Film 
Review 







Genre  

<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">The film review is a popular way for critics to assess a film’s overall quality and determine 
whether or not they think the film is worth recommending.  Film reviews differ from scholarly 
film articles in that they encompass personal and idiosyncratic reactions to and evaluations of a 
film, as well as objective analyses of the film’s formal techniques and thematic content.</span>   

Preparing to Write the Review 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">While film reviews tend to be fairly short (approximately 600 to 1200 words), they require a lot 
of preparation before you begin writing.  Prior to viewing the film, you may want to get a sense 
of the bodies of work by the director, writer, or individual actor.  For instance, you may watch 
other films by the same director or writer in order to get a sense of each individual style.  This 
will enable you to contextualize the film and determine whether it works as a continuation and/or 
disruption within the broad trends of the director’s or writer’s work.</span>   

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Writing a film review often requires multiple viewings of the film. Plan to watch the film two or 
even three times.  During the first viewing, surrender yourself to the cinematic experience; in 
other words, get lost in the narrative and enjoy the film without worrying about the argument you 
will eventually cultivate.  During your second viewing, try distancing yourself from the plot and 
instead focus on interesting elements of the film that you can highlight in the review.  You may 
separate these elements into two broad categories: 1) formal techniques such as cinematography, 
editing, mise-en-scene, lighting, diegetic and non-diegetic sound, genre, or narratology, and 2) 
thematic content that resonates with issues such as history, race, gender, sexuality, class, or the 
environment.   

After watching the film a second time, take careful notes on the formal and thematic elements of 
the film.</span>  Then attempt to create a central idea for your review that brings together the film’s 
formal and thematic elements.  If your second viewing does not yield a strong central claim for 
the review or if you need to take more notes, you may have to watch the film or parts of the film 
a third time.

Writing the Film Review 

Although there is not a set formula to follow when writing a film review, the genre does have 
certain common elements that most film reviews include.  

1) Introduction 
- 
In the opening of your review, provide some basic information about the film.  You 
may include film’s name, year, director, screenwriter, and major actors.   
- 
Your introduction, which may be longer than one paragraph, should also begin to 
evaluate the film, and it should allude to the central concept of the review.  A film 
review does not have to contain a thesis or main claim, but it should focus on a 
central analysis and assessment.     
2) Plot Summary  
- 
Remember that many readers of film reviews have not yet seen the film.  While you 
want to provide some plot summary, keep this brief and avoid specific details that 
would spoil the viewing for others.   
3) Description  
- 
While the plot summary will give the reader a general sense of what the film is about, 
also include a more detailed description of your particular cinematic experience 
watching the film.  This may include your personal impression of what the film looks, 
feels, and sounds like.  In other words, what stands out in your mind when you think 
about this particular film?  
4) Analysis 
- 
In order to explain your impression of the film, consider how well the film utilizes 
formal techniques and thematic content.  How do the film’s formal techniques (such 
as cinematography, editing, mise-en-scène, lighting, diegetic and non-diegetic sound, 
genre, or narrative) affect the way the film looks, feels, and sounds to you?  How 
does the thematic content (such as history, race, gender, sexuality, class, or the 
environment) affect your experience and interpretation?  Also, do the formal 
techniques work to forward the thematic content?   
5) Conclusion/Evaluation 
- 
The closing of your film review should remind the reader of your general thoughts 
and impressions of the film.  You may also implicitly or explicitly state whether or 
not you recommend the film.  Make sure to remind the reader of why the film is or is 
not worth seeing.   
Examples of Film Reviews 

One of the best ways to learn how to write a film review is simply by reading good film reviews.  
You can find examples in most major newspapers and magazines.  Check out the arts and 
entertainment sections of The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The New 
Yorker, The Atlantic, or Rolling Stone.

Recommended Texts 

Corrigan, Timothy.  A Short Guide to Writing about Film.  New York: Longman, 2001. 

Part of Longman’s Short Guide series, Corrigan discusses different approaches to film 
and provides useful tips on ways to begin writing about film.  The book includes a 
glossary of technical film terms, and a section of the book deals with these terms in more 
detail.  It also features sample essays and a section on conducting film research.  

Bordwell, David and Kristen Thompson.  Film Art: An Introduction.  New York: McGraw 

Hill, 2006.  

First published in 1979 and updated every few years, Bordwell and Thompson’s book has 
become the standard textbook for film courses.  Although the authors pay attention to 
genre, history, production, and distribution, the book is most useful for its attention to 
style and how formal aspects of films create meaning.  It is a bit much to get through for 
a single paper on film, but is a useful resource, featuring a glossary of discipline-specific 
terms and clearly delineated chapters on different aspects of film analysis.  

Useful Links 

Internet Movie Database (IMDb):  
www.imdb.com  

For quick information about a film, director, actor, producer, or production company, 
IMDb can’t be beat.  It is not an ideal place to end your research, but it is a fine place to 
start.  

Duke Writing Studio’s “Visual Rhetoric/Visual Literary: Writing about Film”: 
http://twp.duke.edu/uploads/media_items/film.original.pdf   

This handout provides an excellent overview of how to approach film as a visual 
medium.  It also discusses several key film terms and formal features that one should pay 
attention to when moving from a passive to an active viewing experience.  

Dartmouth Writing Program Handout on Film: 
http://www.dartmouth.edu/~writing/materials/student/humanities/film.shtml  

This handout is more focused on writing about film than on visual literacy, and it 
discusses different approaches to film (film history, ideological analysis, cultural 
studies/national cinemas, and auteur theory) not addressed in the Duke Writing Studio 
handout.  It also features a short glossary of film terms.
