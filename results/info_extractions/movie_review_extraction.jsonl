Film reviews differ from scholarly \nfilm articles in that they encompass personal and idiosyncratic reactions to and evaluations of a \nfilm, as well as objective analyses of the film’s formal techniques and thematic content.   \n \nPreparing to Write the Review \n \nWhile film reviews tend to be fairly short (approximately 600 to 1200 words), they require a lot \nof preparation before you begin writing.  Prior to viewing the film, you may want to get a sense \nof the bodies of work by the director, writer, or individual actor.  For instance, you may watch \nother films by the same director or writer in order to get a sense of each individual style.

Then attempt to create a central idea for your review that brings together the film’s \nformal and thematic elements.  If your second viewing does not yield a strong central claim for \nthe review or if you need to take more notes, you may have to watch the film or parts of the film \na third time.   \n \n\n \nDuke Writing Studio  \n \n2 \n \n \nWriting the Film Review \n \nAlthough there is not a set formula to follow when writing a film review, the genre does have \ncertain common elements that most film reviews include.  \n \n1) Introduction \n- \nIn the opening of your review, provide some basic information about the film.  You \nmay include film’s name, year, director, screenwriter, and major actors.   \n- \nYour introduction, which may be longer than one paragraph, should also begin to \nevaluate the film, and it should allude to the central concept of the review.  A film \nreview does not have to contain a thesis or main claim, but it should focus on a \ncentral analysis and assessment.     \n2) Plot Summary  \n- \nRemember that many readers of film reviews have not yet seen the film.  While you \nwant to provide some plot summary, keep this brief and avoid specific details that \nwould spoil the viewing for others.   \n3) Description  \n- \nWhile the plot summary will give the reader a general sense of what the film is about, \nalso include a more detailed description of your particular cinematic experience \nwatching the film.  This may include your personal impression of what the film looks, \nfeels, and sounds like.  In other words, what stands out in your mind when you think \nabout this particular film?  \n4) Analysis \n- \nIn order to explain your impression of the film, consider how well the film utilizes \nformal techniques and thematic content.  How do the film’s formal techniques (such \nas cinematography, editing, mise-en-scène, lighting, diegetic and non-diegetic sound, \ngenre, or narrative) affect the way the film looks, feels, and sounds to you?  How \ndoes the thematic content (such as history, race, gender, sexuality, class, or the \nenvironment) affect your experience and interpretation?  Also, do the formal \ntechniques work to forward the thematic content?   \n5) Conclusion/Evaluation \n- \nThe closing of your film review should remind the reader of your general thoughts \nand impressions of the film.  You may also implicitly or explicitly state whether or \nnot you recommend the film.  Make sure to remind the reader of why the film is or is \nnot worth seeing.   \nExamples of Film Reviews \n \nOne of the best ways to learn how to write a film review is simply by reading good film reviews.  \nYou can find examples in most major newspapers and magazines.  Check out the arts and \nentertainment sections of The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The New \nYorker, The Atlantic, or Rolling Stone. \n \n\n \nDuke Writing Studio  \n \n3 \n \n \nRecommended Texts \n \nCorrigan, Timothy.  A Short Guide to Writing about Film.  New York: Longman, 2001. \n \nPart of Longman’s Short Guide series, Corrigan discusses different approaches to film \nand provides useful tips on ways to begin writing about film.  The book includes a \nglossary of technical film terms, and a section of the book deals with these terms in more \ndetail.  It also features sample essays and a section on conducting film research.  \n  \nBordwell, David and Kristen Thompson.  Film Art: An Introduction.  New York: McGraw \n \nHill, 2006.  \n \nFirst published in 1979 and updated every few years, Bordwell and Thompson’s book has \nbecome the standard textbook for film courses.  Although the authors pay attention to \ngenre, history, production, and distribution, the book is most useful for its attention to \nstyle and how formal aspects of films create meaning.  It is a bit much to get through for \na single paper on film, but is a useful resource, featuring a glossary of discipline-specific \nterms and clearly delineated chapters on different aspects of film analysis.  \n \nUseful Links \n \nInternet Movie Database (IMDb):  \nwww.imdb.com  \n \nFor quick information about a film, director, actor, producer, or production company, \nIMDb can’t be beat.  It is not an ideal place to end your research, but it is a fine place to \nstart.  \n \nDuke Writing Studio’s “Visual Rhetoric/Visual Literary: Writing about Film”: \nhttp://twp.duke.edu/uploads/media_items/film.original.pdf   \n \nThis handout provides an excellent overview of how to approach film as a visual \nmedium.  It also discusses several key film terms and formal features that one should pay \nattention to when moving from a passive to an active viewing experience.  \n \nDartmouth Writing Program Handout on Film: \nhttp://www.dartmouth.edu/~writing/materials/student/humanities/film.shtml  \n \nThis handout is more focused on writing about film than on visual literacy, and it \ndiscusses different approaches to film (film history, ideological analysis, cultural \nstudies/national cinemas, and auteur theory) not addressed in the Duke Writing Studio \nhandout.  It also features a short glossary of film terms.  \n \n \n \n", "document_id": "doc_cca04196"}
